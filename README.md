# adult_50k
For this project we will be using the University of California, Irvine Adult Data Set. I will be predicting if the people in this dataset belong in a certian class of salary, either making <=50k or >50k per year.

This project involves data cleaning, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis and a prediction task with log regression.
